# React + TypeScript + Vite

In order to make the app work, you must add a .env file to the project root.

Because right now we're using a public API you can just create the .env and add the following line to it:
VITE_API_URL=https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3

After doing this, the app will be able to fetch the coins and render the price charts for them.
